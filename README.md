- conda create -n sensor python=3.9 -y
- conda activate sensor

### Step:3 

- "PyPI (Python Package Index) is the official repository for Python packages, allowing developers to publish and install reusable code libraries to streamline development and promote modularity."

- A well-organized project *FOLDER STRUCTURE* with packages is essential to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability of code in a production-ready machine learning pipeline.

- template.py (python template.py)
